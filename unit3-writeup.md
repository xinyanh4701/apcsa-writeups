## Concept: Objects (UNIT 3)

### Context
I have finished Unit 2 of APCSA which was objects. I am now learning about conditionals in Unit 3. We use conditionals (using logical conditions) to help us perform different actions. An example would be if a number is greater than 10, perform this certain task and if a number is greater than 10, perform a different task.
### Overview
#### `if` Statements
`if` statements will execute the code of block if the condition is met. They are usually the most used statement.

Format of `if` Statements:
```java
if(/*condition*/){
    // code here
}
```
#### Relational Operators
Relational Operators are used to check if a primitive or reference value is larger, smaller, or not equal to each other. Here are some relational operators:
* `==` - Equal to
* `<` - Less than
* `<=` - Less than or equal to
* `>` - Greater than
* `>=` - Greater than or equal to
* `!=` - Not equal to 

#### `else` Statements
`else` statements are executed when an `if` statement is false.

Format of an `else` Statement:
```java
else {
    // code here
}
```
#### `else if` Statements
`else if` statements are another type of statement. They are placed between the `if` statement and the `else` statement.

Format of an `else if` Statement:
```java
else if (/*condition*/){
    // code here
}
```
#### Logical Operators
Logical operators can also be used to represent multiple conditions in one statement. Here are some logical operators:
* `&&` - AND (Both conditions need to be true to evaluate the condition as true)
* `||` - OR (Either condition needs to be true to evaluate the condition as true)
* `!` - NOT (Evaluate the condition as the opposite)

### Challenges
#### Exam / Quiz Questions
After doing lessons 1 - 4, my class and I would have a quiz to check our understanding. I got two questions wrong for this Unit 3 quiz.

This is the first question:

### Takeaways
* Reread the questions a few more times to make sure you understand what the prompt is actually asking you
